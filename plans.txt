General idea: Take a binary blob file and a block size.  Search through it and
attempt to reconstruct images without information about whole files or block
ordering.

Block selection/heristics/whatever:
  -various approaches here?
  -Entropy analysis, search based on filesystem type, ...

JPEG decoding
  -General approach: Throw data at libjpeg and use error callbacks to try
   other blocks.
  -Metadata
    -Look for tags at expected offsets based on size
    -Size is always either constant or denoted - false positives (4 bytes in
     the expected location match) very unlikely.
  -Image data
    -Pass each line to libjpeg & try to decode
    -Keep trying new blocks until one works
    -If you get a scanline out, think carefully about the image 
     data entropy (esp. in the back half): if it's garbage it probably didn't match

Other formats
  -PNG/GIF/others similarly formatted, can probably generalize code.
  -Entropy/similarity analysis code can be shared.


when fill buffer gets called not on a fresh image, kick back out to tell
the main loop what's going on and to check entropy shits or whatever (return
FALSE)

fucked up huff error likely at that point, will longjmp back to the error handler.
