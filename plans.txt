Block selection/heristics/whatever:
  -various approaches here?
  -Entropy analysis, search based on filesystem type, ...

JPEG decoding
  -Metadata
    -Look for tags at expected offsets based on size
  -Image data
    -Pass each line to libjpeg & try to decode
    -Keep trying new blocks until one works

Other formats
  -PNG/GIF/others similarly formatted, can probably generalize
